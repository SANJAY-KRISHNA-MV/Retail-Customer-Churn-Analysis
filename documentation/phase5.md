Phase 5: Visualization & Communication
Phase Overview
This crucial phase focused on transforming the insights derived from the churn prediction model into an accessible, interactive, and user-friendly dashboard. The primary goal was to empower business stakeholders to understand customer churn, identify at-risk customers, and grasp the key factors driving churn, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making for retention strategies.

1. Tool Selection: Streamlit for Interactive Dashboard
Given the Python-centric nature of the project and the need for a easily shareable and runnable application from a GitHub repository, Streamlit was chosen as the primary tool for developing the interactive dashboard. Streamlit allows for the creation of rich web applications purely in Python, making it ideal for data science showcases. Plotly Express was used within Streamlit for generating interactive and visually appealing charts.

2. Dashboard Development (src/visualization_app.py)
The interactive dashboard application was developed as a Python script (src/visualization_app.py). It follows a structured approach to load the necessary data and the trained machine learning model, and then present various analytical views.

Key Components and Functionality:
Data and Model Loading:

The dashboard loads the customer_churn_predictions.csv (containing engineered features and model predictions) and the best_churn_model.joblib (the trained Gradient Boosting Classifier). Data and model loading are cached (@st.cache_data, @st.cache_resource) for improved performance.

Robust error handling is implemented to gracefully manage scenarios where data or model files are not found.

Overall Churn Insights:

Provides a high-level overview of key metrics using Streamlit's st.metric component.

Displays the Total Customers, Actual Churn Rate (based on the defined churn window), Predicted Churn Rate, and the Number of Predicted Churners.

Churn Drivers & Customer Segmentation:

Top Features Influencing Churn: Utilizes the feature importances extracted from the loaded Gradient Boosting model to display the top 10 features that most significantly predict churn. This is visualized using an interactive horizontal bar chart powered by Plotly Express, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify core churn drivers (e.g., Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Tenure).

Churn Rate by Country Group: Presents a bar chart showing the churn rate across different country groups. This helps in understanding geographical variations in churn and potentially tailoring region-specific retention efforts.

At-Risk Customers List:

Offers an interactive section to identify customers predicted to be at high risk of churning.

A Streamlit slider allows users to dynamically adjust the churn probability threshold. Customers with a predicted churn probability above this threshold are displayed in a filterable table.

The table includes essential customer details (Customer ID, churn_probability, predicted_churn) along with their RFM and Tenure values, and their primary country. This enables targeted investigation and intervention for individual at-risk customers.

st.column_config is used to enhance the table's readability with progress bars for probabilities and formatted numeric values.

3. Empowerment for End-Users
This dashboard serves as the crucial bridge between complex machine learning models and actionable business intelligence. It empowers end-users by:

Simplifying Complex Insights: Presenting model outputs and statistical findings in intuitive visual formats.

Enabling Targeted Actions: Providing a clear list of at-risk customers for focused retention campaigns.

Informing Strategy: Highlighting key churn drivers, allowing the business to address root causes of churn through product improvements, service enhancements, or marketing adjustments.

Interactive Exploration: Allowing users to slice and dice the data and adjust thresholds, fostering deeper engagement and understanding.

4. Execution
The Streamlit application can be run directly from the command line from the project's root directory:
streamlit run src/visualization_app.py

This completes Phase 5, culminating in a practical and impactful data product that effectively communicates the project's findings.
