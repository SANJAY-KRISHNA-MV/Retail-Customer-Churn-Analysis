Great! I'm ready to help you get started on the "Retail Customer Churn Analysis" project. Documenting as we go is an excellent habit, especially for a portfolio project, as it demonstrates professionalism and clarity.

We'll follow a typical data science project workflow. For each step, I'll outline the objective, the tasks involved, and what you should document.

Project Setup & Initial Documentation
Before we even touch the data, let's set up our project environment and create the initial documentation structure.

Phase 1: Project Initialization & Environment Setup
Objective: To create a well-organized project directory and set up a reproducible development environment.

Tasks:

Create Project Directory: Set up a root directory for your project.
Initialize Git Repository: Turn this directory into a Git repository for version control.
Create README.md: Start a README.md file in the root directory to describe your project.
Set Up Virtual Environment: Create a Python virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
Create requirements.txt: Start listing your dependencies.
Initial Commit: Make your first commit to Git.
Documentation (What to include in your README.md):

Project Title: Retail Customer Churn Analysis
Overview: A brief 1-2 sentence description of the project's goal (predicting customer churn in a retail context to inform retention strategies).
Problem Statement: Briefly explain why churn prediction is important for a retail business.
Dataset: Mention the UCI Online Retail II dataset as the chosen data source and briefly explain why it's suitable (transactional data for inferring churn). You can include the link to the dataset.
Goal: Reiterate the core objective: to build a model that identifies customers at risk of churning and derives insights for retention.
Skills Demonstrated: List the key skills you aim to showcase (Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering (RFM), Statistical Modeling/ML, Visualization, Version Control, Business Acumen).
Repository Structure (Planned): Briefly outline the directories you plan to create (e.g., data/, notebooks/, src/, reports/).
Setup Instructions: How someone can get the project running locally (Git clone, create virtual environment, install dependencies).
